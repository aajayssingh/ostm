Contains the HT-OSTM library and the code for experimenting the HT-OSTM against the TLDS (Norec STM, Boosting, transactional list), synchrobench and in house developed read write stm (IITH-STM). The work is done as part of my Master thesis at IIT Hyderabad.

Paths:

HT-OSTM library  ---> lib: ./ostm-lib
TLDS code        ---> lib: ./ws-tlds


The directory ostm-synchrobench_time&abort compares the HT-OSTM against ESTM of synchrobench and IITH-STM technique.
IITH-STM library 		---> ./ostm-synchrobench/IITH_STM
Synchrobench library    --->  ./ostm-synchrobench/ESTM 

g++ -std=c++14 main.cpp ostm-lib/ostm.cpp ostm-lib/tablsl.cpp -o OSTM -lpthread

Instructions to compile the individual libraries and collecting stats are mentioned within each directories.
